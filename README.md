# Open Source Opportunities for Good Causes

If you are a maintainer of a charity/non-profit open-source project or you can recommend such an open-source project, add it to the list:  fork this repo, add the details to the README.md and issue a PR. State what the main language/framework is.

If you are a good cause and are interested in benefitting from open source, give me a shout.

Inspired by [NBN Atlas project hub](https://github.com/nbnuk/nbn-project-hub)  that I maintain (listed below).


## React 

- [NBN Atlas project hub](https://github.com/nbnuk/nbn-project-hub) <br>  Get stuck in developing React components for the NBN Atlas of UK biodiversity data. We need simple, visually cool components that nature based charities and voluntary organisations can use in their websites. Help us make a difference. (Also looking to start an Expo component package and interested in ideas for Python (big data?) projects.)
